# Text-Rewriter
JavaScript/HTML app which rewrites a text, maintaining its full meaning, but avoiding plagiarism.

To run give it a try, simply download the Text-Rewriter.html file and run it in a browser. You may also paste it in any JavaScript/HTML compatible text window.

Currently, I'm only working on the develop branch, so if you want to give Text-Rewriter.html a try, you'll have to download it from the develop branch.
